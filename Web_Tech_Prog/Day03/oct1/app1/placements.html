      At SunBeam, the mission is not only to deliver the course effectively but
      also to shape our trainees into software professionals readily deployable
      in the industry. We see our responsibility as that of facilitates and
      guides, guiding the student through the prequalifying exam, the actual DAC
      course and also in the industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keeping in mind the industry expectations, we supplement the technical
      contents of the course with many extra curricular activities like
      workshop, regular aptitude tests etc. Our placement cell works around the
      year to arrange for placement interviews and job opportunities for our
      students.

    <p>
      Many leading industries have visited our campus in the past and the list
      is ever increasing. The dedicated work of our placement teams provides a
      platform for our student to showcase their skills and the efforts they
      have put in during the course to secure for themselves a bright future in
      the software industry.
